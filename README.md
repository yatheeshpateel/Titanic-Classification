# Titanic-Classification                                                
This is a machine learning project that predicts whether a person would have survived the sinking of the Titanic based on their socio-economic status, age, gender, and more.

# Installation
Before running this project, you will need to install the following packages:                                          

pandas                                                                
numpy                                  
matplotlib                             
seaborn                            
sklearn                                            
                                      
You can install these packages by running the following command in your terminal:
   pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn sklearn                                                     
   
# Usage
Clone or download this repository to your local machine                        
Open the Jupyter notebook file Titanic_Classification.ipynb in your Jupyter notebook application.                             
Run the cells to train the machine learning model and make predictions on the test data.                                         
The last cell will output the accuracy score of the model on the test data, as well as a confusion matrix and classification report.
